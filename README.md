Welcome to the XIP&trade; Skeletal Application Project!
=======================================================

The [eXtensible Imaging Platform&trade; (XIP&trade;)](http://www.OpenXIP.org) is an
Open Source project that provides a framework for developing image processing and
visualization applications.  While XIP's emphasis is medical applications, it can be 
used for other types of applications.

This repository holds the base skeleton for a
[DICOM Hosted Application](http://medical.nema.org/Dicom/2011/11_19pu.pdf)
built with the XIP framework.  Starting from this skeleton, developers may
create more complete XIP-based applications.  

The ultimate goals of the project include:

* Provide a framework for creating
  [DICOM Hosted Applications](http://medical.nema.org/Dicom/2011/11_19pu.pdf) in XIP&trade;.
* Provide a Java Swing GUI framework for incorporating XIP scene graphs, create with
  nodes and engines from the [XIP Libraries&trade;](https://github.com/OpenXIP/xip-libraries)
  into an application.
* Build the XIPApp.jar file, which developers may include in creating their applications.
* Provide test apps to illustrate the use of the skeleton, which also help
  validate its functionality.
